;NOTES:
;
;The goal of this AI is to create different personalities to play with each
;game. The personalities are meant to reflect the styles of different generals
;or leaders of the Middle Ages, hence the name of the AI. Each civilization will
;select from at least two generals that will have different playing styles,
;whether that will be aggressive and dominant, or intelligent and calculating,
;defensive and expansive, or sneaky and unpredictable. When finished, the AI will
;hopefully provide a challenging and entertaining experience.
